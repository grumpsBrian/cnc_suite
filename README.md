# cnc_suite
CNC Suite is a self‑contained desktop application for:   - CNC toolpath preview - Laser engraving image preparation - DXF handling - Raster‑to‑G‑code conversion .
CNC Suite was created as a practical, all‑in‑one CNC helper tool. Feel free to use it, fork it, improve it, or build on it as you like.
Created by myself for my own personal use but I am happy to share it with you, I accept no responsibility for what you do with it.
